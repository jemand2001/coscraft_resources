# CosCraft resource pack

The official add-on resource pack for the **CosCraft** (Cosmere in Minecraft) project. Based on and designed for use *on top of* the **Excalibur** resource pack!
*Currently available for Minecraft 1.12 and 1.14*

## Installation

On the [github page](https://github.com/jemand2001/coscraft_resources), click on the *clone or download* button, and select *Download ZIP*. Download the file into your resource pack folder.
Alternatively, navigate your terminal to your resource pack folder and run the command `git clone https://github.com/jemand2001/coscraft_resources.git`
For an optimal experience, you will also want to download the [Excalibur resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/excalibur).

Next, start Minecraft 1.14.4 and navigate to the Resource Pack screen. You should be able to see the **Excalibur** and **CosCraft** resource packs. Select both and order them so that **Excalibur** is below **CosCraft**. Enjoy!
